# iOS_DogBreedApp
A iOS app created in Xcode using Swift incorporating core data for persistent memory. In the app you can add, edit and favourite dog breeds. 

Known Issues:

If you enter a new entry of dog breed, you cannot favourite it at the same time. Instead, go back into the entry and then click favourite(heart icon). Also, when selecting an image for the new entry, you have to give it a name in the info field for the image, otherwise, the placeholder image will trigger.
